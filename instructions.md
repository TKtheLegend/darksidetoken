# **DARKSIDE: A New Era of Onchain Music & Tokenized Artistry**

The **onchain music revolution** isn’t new. I’ve been experimenting in this space for years—launching over **30 onchain records**, creating **multi-layered audiovisual projects**, and building  **Eternal Garden**, a universe where music, art, and technology merge into something greater.

But through all of these experiments, I’ve encountered the **same problem over and over again**—one that **every independent artist trying to build in Web3** eventually runs into:

👉 **How do you create a tokenized music experience that actually works—for both artists and fans?**

👉 **How do you bring real liquidity into a project without selling out its soul?**

👉 **How do you prevent Web3's toxic cycle of speculation from destroying genuine artistic innovation?**

My research company Eternal Labs has been searching for answer.

The answer to these questions is **DARKSIDE**.

This isn’t just an album. It’s a **new system**, a **new model**, and a **new experiment** that could redefine how artists and fans interact in the Web3 space.

## **Where Onchain Music Started: NFTs**

For a time, **NFTs were the most successful form factor for onchain music.** They allowed artists to sell digital collectibles, build new revenue streams, and give fans **a stake in their success.**

### **The Problem: Why Onchain Music Has Struggled**

But then the **secondary market collapsed**—and with it, the sustainability of NFTs as a long-term model for music.

The **core issue?**

🚨 **Most NFT holders weren’t actual fans—they were speculators.**

- Many collectors **bought NFTs hoping for price appreciation, not because they cared about the music.**
- Artists struggled to **convert NFT holders into real supporters**—many people who bought never streamed the songs or engaged with the artist outside of Web3.
- Utility became a **trap**—musicians felt pressured to **overpromise** just to keep NFT holders happy, leading to burnout and unsustainable commitments.

At the end of the day, **NFTs became more about trading than music.**

Subsequently, the recent bear market crushed the **art and music sectors of web3**. The focus shifted back to **pure trading and speculation**, leaving real creators in the dust.

🔑 **DARKSIDE fixes this by flipping the model: you must be a fan first.**

Instead of selling music NFTs upfront, **our tokens are earned, not bought.**

- You have to **stream the music**
- You have to **engage with the rollout**
- You have to **participate in the ecosystem**

Only **real fans** who actively support the album **get early access to the token.**

This ensures that **the people who hold $DARKSIDE (or $GORGEOUS) are actually engaged.** It prevents **a speculative bubble** from forming before the project even has a chance to grow.

Instead of **chasing liquidity through hype**, we **build liquidity through fandom.**

## **Why Fan Incentivization Matters: The Role of Digital Street Teams**

Artists have always relied on **street teams**—grassroots movements of passionate fans spreading the word, handing out flyers, requesting songs on the radio, and building hype. Some of the most **successful artists of all time** owe their rise to **early supporters** who championed their music before the mainstream caught on.

The **digital era didn’t change the need for street teams—it just changed how they work.**

Social media turned **engagement into currency**—but the problem is, platforms reap all the rewards while **fans, the ones driving success, get nothing in return.**

I’ve been a pioneer in **digital street teams with onchain incentives** because I believe:

🔥 **Curation is important**—fans should be rewarded for their taste and influence.

🔥 **Support should be recognized**—early believers deserve more than just bragging rights.

🔥 **Artists and fans should win together**—not just platforms, labels, or middlemen.

That’s why I’ve spent the last few years **testing different models**:

- **Petal Power**—a viral marketing experiment where fans **earned social tokens and USD rewards** for amplifying content.
- **Formless**—a pay-for-access streaming experiment that **turned fans into revenue participants**.

Each one **pushed the boundaries** of what’s possible in Web3 music—but they also revealed the **core issue**:

🔑 **Liquidity is the lifeblood of any token experiment. Without it, the system collapses before it even begins.**

So how do we solve this?

## **The Solution: DARKSIDE’s New Token Economy**

With **DARKSIDE**, I’m flipping the script. Instead of just dropping an album and hoping people show up, I’m launching a **fully integrated onchain economy** around it—where every song is **paired with a corresponding token** that exists on a **bonding curve.**

**Bonding curves aren’t new**—but what’s different is **how this will work**:

1️⃣ The **first token** will be **$DARKSIDE.**

2️⃣ This token **can’t be bought right away**—instead, it must be **mined** through **quests**:

- **Streaming the music**
- **Reposting key social media content**
- **Engaging in the rollout**3️⃣ Completing these quests earns you **"Insider" status**, which gives you **early allocations of the token** before the **contract address (CA) goes public.**4️⃣ Once the token is **released to the open market**, our Insiders—**the real supporters**—already have a stake, **monetizing their efforts** instead of just being spectators.

This does **three critical things**:

✅ **Creates liquidity before the token launch**

✅ **Rewards supporters, not just speculators**

✅ **Builds a PVE (player vs. environment) economy around each song**

Instead of just **dropping an album**, we’re creating **an ecosystem**—where the **music, the token, and the community fuel each other** in a **sustainable way**.

## **The Dangers of Creator Tokens**

We’ve seen how **crypto reacts to creators launching tokens**—and it’s almost always **a disaster**:

- If an artist launches a token, **traders immediately snipe it, flip it, and drain liquidity.**
- If an artist does it "the right way"—slow, intentional, and community-driven—**they make no money** and end up putting in more effort than they do on their actual music.
- If they do make money, **crypto people pressure them to pour every cent back in**, turning them into unwilling fund managers instead of artists.

This system is **broken all around**—but instead of complaining about it, we will build solutions.

## **No False Promises—Just Intentionality**

Let’s be real: **most coins go to zero.**

We’re not here to sell dreams or make empty promises. What we *are* doing is designing **a system that is built to last** and actually benefits all participants.

At its core, **DARKSIDE is a PVE (Player vs. Environment) experience.**

It’s about **rallying a community around something dope.**

🔥 **Building an ecosystem where fans and artists both benefit.**

🔥 **Creating a new model for music and tokenization that actually works.**

We’re closing the loop by **building real, actionable utility into the token.**

Here’s how:

- **Utility that matters** – DARKSIDE tokens will have **redeemable use cases**, ensuring that the token is more than just a speculative asset.
- **Deflationary mechanics** – Strategic locks & **burns of token supply** to **increase value over time.**
- **Sustained token value** – As **DARKSIDE expands**, the token isn’t just an afterthought—it’s **integrated into the project’s long-term growth.**

## **This is Just the Beginning**

With DARKSIDE, we’re **laying down the foundation**—but this is just the first step.

**What we’re building here isn’t just an album release strategy. It’s a model.**

A model that could be **scaled and replicated** for other independent artists. A model that ensures **liquidity, sustainability, and true fan engagement.**

I don’t expect to have **all the answers**—but I do know that if we keep **pushing, testing, and iterating**, we can figure this out together.

This is DARKSIDE.

This is the next evolution of onchain music.

And this is **just the beginning.**

# TOKENOMICS

### **Why This Matters**

Most creator tokens **fail because of poor tokenomics**—either the **founder holds too much**, early supporters **dump everything**, or there’s **no actual reason to hold the token.**

DARKSIDE is **different.**

- It **incentivizes real fans first.**
- It **locks out speculation until the ecosystem is healthy.**
- It **creates sustainable incentives for both insiders & the broader Web3 music space.**

This isn’t about **a one-time launch**—this is about **building an onchain economy that actually works for artists and fans alike.**
